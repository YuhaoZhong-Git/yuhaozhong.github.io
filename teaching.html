<h1>Teaching Experience</h1>

<h2>Instructor</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ISEN 414: Total Quality Engineering (Spring 2024) – 39 undergraduate students</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This class consisted of: 27 lectures, 9 laboratories, 25 quizzes, 7 homework assignments, 2 exams, and 1 final project.</p>

<p>Course Evaluation (Selected feedback from students):</p>
<ul>
    <li>"Great job for first time teaching! Very understanding, fair professor. Homework assignments were challenging but the professor and TA would answer my questions promptly."</li>
    <li>"I personally enjoyed taking this course and it definitely helped me understand quality engineering. The only thing I would critique about this course are the lecture slides that the professor makes, where there are repeated concepts in every lecture that is posted. This makes it slightly more difficult to navigate through the slides to study. Other than that, I felt like Mr. Zhong did a good job teaching this course, and his exams covered the topics in his lectures well so us students knew what to expect."</li>
    <li>"Very interesting course, one of my favorite ISEN courses (information-wise)."</li>
</ul>
