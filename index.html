  My research focuses on advancing Data Science techniques to address fundamental challenges related to quality and performance assurance, 
    as well as knowledge discovery, 
    primarily in Manufacturing processes and systems in the context of Industry 4.0/5.0.

  I am also interested in <a href="projects/">open-source</a> NLP and deep learning, and
  develop projects to make deep learning systems safer, more clear, and easier to
  use.
  I work part-time at <a href="http://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> and like to release various software
  projects to support NLP and DL research.
