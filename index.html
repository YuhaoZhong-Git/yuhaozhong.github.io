  My <a href="papers/">research</a> aims to build and improve
  generative AI. We are interested primarily in tasks that involve
  text generation, historically translation, summarization, and
  data-to-text generation. Methodologically, we study
  data-driven probabilistic methods that combine deep-learning
  based models with probabilistic controls.

<p style="font-size: 18px">
  I am also interested in <a href="projects/">open-source</a> NLP and deep learning, and
  develop projects to make deep learning systems safer, more clear, and easier to
  use.
  I work part-time at <a href="http://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> and like to release various software
  projects to support NLP and DL research.
